# Reflection — Version Control Using Git & GitHub

I installed and configured Git, initialized a local repository, created a simple R script (analysis.R) and README, and committed the files. I then created a public repository on GitHub and pushed my local commits. I learned how to resolve PATH issues for R, create and overwrite files using PowerShell, and authenticate with GitHub to push via HTTPS.

Key takeaways:
- Version control creates a clear history and enables collaboration.
- Keep commit messages short and meaningful.
- Always ensure tools (R, Git) are on PATH.

Next steps: use branching and pull requests for collaboration, and add .gitignore to avoid committing large data files.
